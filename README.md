Atbash Cipher

A simple Python implementation of the classic Atbash substitution cipher.
The cipher works by reversing the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, …).
The same function is used for both encryption and decryption.

Features

Encrypts and decrypts text using Atbash

Supports uppercase and lowercase letters

Keeps spaces, numbers, and punctuation unchanged

Usage

Run the script:

python atbash_cipher.py


Example:

Input: Hello, World!
Output: Svool, Dliow!

How It Works

Each letter is mapped to its opposite alphabet position using ASCII calculations.
